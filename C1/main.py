name = 'nafis'
age = 20
print('my name is ', name + ' and my age is', age)

#Programming:
#Q1 : Declare 4 valriables (Type: string, int, float, boolean) and print these variables.
#Q2 : Suppose my name is nafis and I am 20 years old and I am a teen ager. declare three varibles (int, string, boolean) then print name age and if i am a teen ager in a single statement.
#Q3 : Suppose there are two variable one is int and another is floating value. Print the sum, sub, mult of these two values.
#Q4 : Take your name and age as an input then print it in a single statement.
#Q5 : Take two inputs and print the sum, sub, mult of the two values.
#Theory:
#Q1 : What is a python interpreter and how does it work?
#Q2 : what is a variable and write five variable types with explanation.
#Q3 : Give detail explanation and an example of Type Error in python programming.
